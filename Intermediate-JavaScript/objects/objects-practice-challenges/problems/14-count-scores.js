/***********************************************************************
Write a function `countScores(people)` that takes in an array of score
objects (people) as its input. A score object has two key-value pairs:
the scorer (string) and a point value (number). `countScores(people)` should
return an object that has key-value pairs listing each person who scored as a key
and the sum of the total points for the game as their value.
